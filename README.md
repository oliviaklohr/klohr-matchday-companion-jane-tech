# Matchday Companion

Friends at Jane Technologies - hey! Just wanted to say thanks for putting this together - I enjoyed the challenge of working through this.

## Details

This project is using Ruby version `3.1.2` and has been run / created on a 2022 MacBook Air running MacOS Monterey `v12.5`.

For insight into my thought process on creating this solution, please see [thoughts.md](thoughts.md). This file isn't super organized, but exists to document how I think in scenarios like this one.

## Usage

1. Run `bundle install` to ensure all dependencies are installed on your machine.
