# Matchday Companion

Friends at Jane Technologies ðŸ’› - hey! Just wanted to say thanks for putting this together - I enjoyed the challenge of working through this.

## Details

This project is using Ruby version `3.1.2` and has been run / created on a 2022 MacBook Air running MacOS Monterey `v12.5`.

For insight into my thought process on creating this solution, please see [thoughts.md](thoughts.md). This file isn't super organized, but exists to document how I think in scenarios like this one.

## Usage

1. Run `bundle install` to ensure all dependencies are installed on your machine.
2. Run `chmod +x bin/main.rb` <!-- TODO: Figure out how to not have to do this lol. There's gotta be a way. -->
3. The command `rspec` will run all associated tests.
4. The Matchday Companion can be run in a variety of ways:
   1. Run `bin/main.rb` without any arguments to input match data via the console line-by-line.
   2. Run `cat <FILE> | bin/main.rb` to pipe the file into the program.
   3. Run `bin/main.rb given-documentation/sample-input.txt` to input match data via a file.

## Assumptions

- Each team plays every day. In a real-world scenario, this is unlikely, but for ease of determining match delimiting, this assumption has been made.
- File input is just a `.txt` file with comma-delimited strings. It is also a file, not a directory.
- Team names don't have commas in them.
